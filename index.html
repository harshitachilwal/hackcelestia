            <h3>Post-Quantum Secure Messaging Layer:</h3>
            <p>
              As quantum computers become more powerful, today’s encryption methods will no longer guarantee privacy. Messaging systems risk being decrypted in the future, exposing sensitive conversations. How can communication remain secure and private — even decades from now — while supporting features like offline use, groups, and message ordering?

              Portable Peer Identity Layer:

            </h3>
            <p>
              Today, most digital identities are tied to big platforms (Google, Apple, Facebook), limiting user control and portability. People lack a universal way to manage their own identities securely across devices and apps. How can we enable individuals to own and carry their digital identity independently of centralized providers?

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Resilient IoT Data Exchange Protocol:</h3>
            <p>
              Billions of IoT devices rely on cloud services and stable internet — but in rural, disaster-prone, or low-power environments, this isn’t reliable. Devices must still exchange data and remain functional even with poor connectivity. How can IoT devices communicate effectively, sync offline, and conserve energy without constant cloud dependency?

            <h3>
              Open Multi-Hop Routing for Browsers
            </h3>
            <p>
              The web today depends heavily on centralized servers, making applications vulnerable to outages, surveillance, and single points of failure. How can browsers themselves directly relay data through multiple peers, enabling resilient, decentralized web applications that continue to function even without central infrastructure?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Universal Offline Content Sync Protocol:</h3>
            <p>
 In areas with poor or intermittent internet, files, updates, and content are often lost or delayed. Users need reliable access across their devices even when connections drop. How can devices automatically sync and share data offline, ensuring updates propagate seamlessly once connectivity returns?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Censorship-Evasion Transport Layer:</h3>
            <p>
In many regions, authorities monitor or block online communication by detecting and filtering traffic. This restricts access to free expression and information. How can communication be disguised in everyday internet traffic so that it remains accessible and censorship-resistant under such conditions?

            <h3>Satellite Data for Disaster Response:</h3>
            <p>
Natural disasters like floods, wildfires, and landslides strike with
little warning, and timely information is critical to saving lives.
Traditional ground-based monitoring often falls short in speed
and coverage. How can satellite imagery and weather data be
harnessed to rapidly detect disasters, assess their impact, and
provide actionable insights for emergency response teams?            </p>

            <h3>Satellite-Backed Emergency Connectivity Kit:</h3>
            <p>
              
When disasters destroy ground infrastructure, entire regions can
lose access to communication — isolating victims and slowing
rescue operations. How can satellite-based communication
channels provide a reliable, lightweight, and accessible way for
people to connect during crises when no internet or cellular
networks are available?            </p>

              Satellite-Powered Wildlife Detection:
            </h3>
            <p>
Conservation of endangered species is limited by the difficulty of
monitoring wildlife across vast, remote, or hostile terrains.
Ground-based tracking is costly and often incomplete. How can
satellite imagery and advanced analysis methods be used to
detect, track, and study wildlife populations at scale —
overcoming challenges like cloud cover, terrain variations, and
seasonal changes — to aid global conservation efforts?            </p>

              Satellite-Enabled Climate Monitoring and Carbon Tracking:
            </h3>
            <p>
Climate change is accelerating, yet precise, real-time tracking of
environmental metrics like deforestation, glacial melt, ocean
temperatures, and greenhouse gas emissions remains
fragmented.
How can satellite constellations and AI-driven analytics be
leveraged to build an accurate, open-access global monitoring
system that tracks carbon emissions, land-use changes, and
environmental degradation — empowering policymakers,
researchers, and communities to take data-driven climate
action?            </p>

Farmers, especially in developing regions, face challenges like
unpredictable weather, inefficient irrigation, and low crop yields.
Satellite data offers a scalable way to monitor soil health, crop
growth, and water availability.
How can multispectral and hyperspectral satellite imagery be
integrated with ground sensors and predictive models to deliver
real-time, location-specific insights that help farmers optimize
resources, reduce waste, and improve food security?            </p>
